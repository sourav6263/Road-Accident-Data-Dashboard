# Road-Accident-Data-Dashboard
Description: Developed an interactive dashboard in Excel for analyzing road accident data, focusing on insights
critical for safety and urban planning. This project involved data cleansing, trend analysis, and visualization of accident metrics such as accident frequency, locations,
contributing factors, and time-based patterns. The dashboard provided actionable insights for stakeholders, enabling them to identify high-risk areas, evaluate factors leading to accidents, and 
implement targeted safety measures. Key features included comparative analysis across locations, accident severity categorization, and temporal analysis to support data-driven decision-making for road safety improvements.
